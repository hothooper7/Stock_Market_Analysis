# Recent Stock Market Analysis

There have been two major downturns in the stock market since March of 2020.  This project will create and train a model that will look for key factors in each downturn and answer the following questions.

    1. Which sectors of the stock market were affected the most during the downturns?  
    2. Which sectors of the stock market were affected the least during the downturns? 
    3. Given all of the conditions that have affected the stock market since 2020, how have ESG (environmental, social, governance) or “socially responsible” stocks performed in comparison to other stocks?
