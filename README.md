# Recent Stock Market Analysis

There have been two major downturns in the stock market since January of 2020.  This project will create and train a model that will look for key factors in each downturn and answer the following questions.

    1. Which sectors of the stock market were affected the most during the downturns?  
    2. Which sectors of the stock market were affected the least during the downturns? 
    3. Given all of the conditions that have affected the stock market since 2020, how have ESG (environmental, social, governance) or “socially responsible” stocks performed in comparison to other stocks?

## Reason for selecting this topic

A vast amount of information is available regarding all facets of the stock market.  In order to create and train a successful model, access to meaningful data is extremely important.  

The collaborators of this project share an interest and curiosity about all things as they relate to the stock market.  This interest combined with the available data lead to the selection of this project.  

## Communication Protocols

The collaborators of this project have kept very open lines of communication, both through slack and zoom.  Each team member has been excellent about being at meetings and understand that if one or more team members is unable to attend, they can be briefed and brought up to speed when they are available.
